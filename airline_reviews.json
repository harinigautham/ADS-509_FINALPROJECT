            "I always loved flying Emirates pre-covid times the planes where modern and luxurious and the staff where friendly and polite (most of the times ) . After Covid tho everything seems to go wrong with Emirates (apart from the food and IFE) Emirates scrambled to get there A380's\u2026\n",

            "The new adverts spurred me to write another review because it is totally misleading unless you are wealthy. Put it this way, Emirates is only for people with money. Lots of money. I was forced to fly Emirates economy for the second time earlier this year and exactly as it was\u2026\n",

            "Flight experience is nice, but I am going to talk about the failure side of Emirates management. It seems that a big company is unable to handle customers concerns and complaints. They have deducted a no show fees by mistake from my refunded ticket. Even though I waited more\u2026\n",

            "It used to be a airline that understood service. We have to pay for seat choice for every stretch. Ridicolous for something that used to be for free and on already expensive tickets. Its a reason not to fly anymore for me in the future with this airline.\n",

Flights in both directions departed and arrived on time, check-in in HK was slower than usual but went fast and smoothly in Vienna on the return leg.

            "This is my first review on the Internet. But I cannot ignore this case. Even without this, it is clear that Emirates has the best service in the world. But among the best there is always the best. And this is customer support manager Noar Sheikh. This man solved an unsolvable\u2026\n",

            "When people travel by plane, they sometimes don't think how many people on the ground are involved in the preparation process to insure a comfortable journey for each person. For the first time my husband & I had the opportunity to take two flights on a Boeing 777 20.09.23.\u2026\n",

            "I was checking in at Counter F1 at KLIA T1, served by your ground staff, Ms Farah around 8.35am to get on EK345 from KL to Dubai. She went ahead to check in my luggage bag and assigned me my seat, 38E. I was shocked and told her I've got a confirmation email that seat 32A was\u2026\n",
            "From the minute one arrives at the lounge, the team takes special care of you. Everything you could want is available, with friendly, professional staff on the job. We've flown Emirates a lot over many years, and will continue to do so, an excellent airline!\n",
            "I wouldn\u2019t say my experience with emirates as a great one. Flight attendants were too busy with business class passengers. They ignored economy class. For a simple glass of water I had to ask them 5-6 times. I had a baby with me and when I asked for a bassinet, one of the\u2026\n",
            "Sadly I forgot my phone on my seat. I contacted lost on found they are not give me the answer almost now 20 days very poor service. I had this kind of situation with Air Canada before I really appreciate them I got my stuff the next day.\n",
            "I have sent an email letting them now that I am pregnant 28 weeks and I will need help incase my transit gate is far, till date I haven\u2019t received feedback. When I reached there , they outrightly refused to help while seeing my bumpy twin pregnancy tummy ! Inhumane. I had to\u2026\n",
            "While our ticket was a bit pricey, I think the onboard experience was great. Both of our flights were aboard Emirates' 777s. We had older aircraft for both of our flights (delivered around 2008), so the cabin did feel a bit dated, especially with the IFEs. While it was\u2026\n",
            "We travelled to and from Dubai ,paying for extra legroom seats in both directions (opposite jump seats adjacent to rear galley) Our journey to Dubai was excellent, great service, lovely food and a relaxing flight, apart from witnessing some cattiness between female attendants as\u2026\n",

            "I had a poor experience on this flight. I have been using Emirates' services for over 20 years, being a Blue member and, then, a Silver member, up until the time of covid. I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates\u2019 service. Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered\u2026\n",
            "The service on the emirates flights have significantly gone down the drain. We fly with emirates on the basis of the service and flight attendants providing an experience to remember. My daughter insisted we take emirates flight to Dubai as she enjoys the trips on the flight.\u2026\n",
            "Cabin crew was pleasant but that's the only compliment I can give to Emirates staff. At least the plane was reasonably clean, although the seats are rather outdated. Food was mediocre, I do not believe that \"plane food\" is an excuse as I genuinely enjoy my meals on British\u2026\n",
            "I am very much satisfied from this flight. The services were too good and everything was comfortable. I am especially happy from the service of a cabin staff member Malik. I would also like to mention the manager of the flight regarding his honesty and services. Excellent\u2026\n",
            "I have been flying with Emirates from years and the service is always been impeccable, but last time they downgraded me from Silver to Blue membership without any warning and the customer service at the Dubai lounge treated me very badly, was the rudest ever, I would not expect\u2026\n",
            "Unless something needs to be addressed, I usually don't bother to offer my input. On September 17, I took flight 368 with Emirates to Bali. The service was nice overall, however their unprofessional cabin manager (Peter) spoiled the trip for us. He shouted at his coworkers and\u2026\n",
            "i been fllying wihh emirates from last 6 years and i travel atleast once a month had bad experiences before didnt want to write reviews today i had to it was very bad , they didnt served me food even i told them and when i asked them what happned they said i was sleeping\u2026\n",
            "This was my first trip for years so I decides to spend some savings and make it special. Zero help on the ground at Melbourne or Dubai. I asked on the plane if I could get some help and was told there would be customer service people, there weren\u2019t. I asked airport staff and\u2026\n",
            "This was my first big trip for years so I decided to spend so of my hard earned savings. The car up was fine, that\u2019s where any service ended. Got dropped at the terminal and I was on my own. There was no 1st class checkin only business and that opened 15 minutes late. Found\u2026\n",
            "Regularly flying with Emirates as a Dubai resident but they\u2019ve really let us down. We paid extra to get a TV into the hold online and were surprised with a \u2018handling fee\u2019 at the airport when we arrived. As we wanted it to be \u2018handled\u2019 correctly, we paid this and they put fragile\u2026\n",
            "Some good some bad very inconsistent The good : My husband and I flew economy Brisbane/Dubai/Rome (paid extra for side twin seats which was worthwhile for extra aisle space and no third person seat). Unfortunately there were no twin seats left on the return flights to pay\u2026\n",
            "At the checkin counter we were told that our luggage will go directly to vancouver as we were taking connections by air canada, as they are code sharing airlines. Fortunately we got delayed at san Francisco immigration with the result that the luggage was out of conveyor belt.\u2026\n",
            "The flight was just fine;albeit a long time since riding in a three class carrier. The crew are consummately skilled and attentive. The A380 center seats are either perfect or distant depending upon your row. Traveling as a family of four, my wife and son were in the row ahead\u2026\n",
            "Abbey Matzev , Tayyaba Masons and Marxam made my flight the best ever! Friendly, social and always attentive! Thank you emirates and to these amazing ladies for the hospitality!\n",
            "Sadly the standards have declined in all areas , with all the money they make it\u2019s a pity it\u2019s not well spent\n",
            "This was my first flight with Emirates in 12 years, I switched to Qatar for my annual flights to UK and only booked with Emirates this time because I was wanting to land closer to my city of destination than I could get with Qatar. My wife's Kipling suitcase arrived at Newcastle\u2026\n",
            "Our first Emirates flight and nothing good to mention. The ground crews and cabin crews were all very arrogant and rude. The responsiveness of the cabin crew was very poor and you have to keep waiting for even a glass of water. The speed of the meal and drink service was very,\u2026\n",
            "One of the worst and insensitive airlines for students. They don't allow Laptop bag and their staff is so insensitive and ask for higher charges on extra luggage. I will strongly advise not to select Emirates if you are student traveling abroad. I will never use this airline\u2026\n"

            "As known, tickets for popular destinations sell out quickly, especially during rush season. In this connection Aeroflot offers interesting booking feature.

            "Punctuality, correct politeness on boarding, \u0441alm in flight, estimated time of arrival at the destination airport. In general, a predictable Aeroflot flight. Expectations do not differ from the fact, there are no disappointments.\n",
            "Everything was good except the changing of the departure time for this flight that led to arrive 2 hours later than expected. Great new plane Airbus A320 Neo.\n",

            "thanks for the high level service throughout the flight from finding tickets to getting off the plane in the destination city\n",
            "If earlier the flight was 2 hours, now it is 4, which of course is not encouraging. However, the entertainment program on board the aircraft saves, you will have time to watch a movie and read a book. Nutrition has improved: instead of sandwiches, puffs with apples. The flight\u2026\n"

            "I can\u2019t believe they even exist, it is the dumbest airline. I don\u2019t understand their policies.

            "Worst airline ever. Be cautious about being taken in by the \"Stay in Panama\" deal. We added the extra leg to visit Panama City from the above named special. This \"special\" deal turns your changeable ticket into a non-changeable ticket. Beware.\n",
            "I have used COPA to the West Coast for years, first the good: The people in the COPA Club at PTY are sweet and really helpful, I misplaced my cell in couch they helped me find it. Please thank them, they were great! The sadder news, my last two trips have been less than\u2026\n",

Staff was dismissive of the customers worries, and were not transparent whatsoever. Please never purchase a Copa Airlines ticket if you\u2026\n",
            "INCOMPETENT, UNPREPARED AND VERY SCARSE GROUND PEOPLE. MY FLIGHT WAS CANCELLED AFTER PASSANGERS WERE HELD FOR 4 HOURS INSIDE THE PLANE!!! AND AFTER THAT WE HAD JUST ONE PERSON TO HANDLE MORE THAN A HUNDRED CUSTOMERS. COPA CANNOT HANDLE IT! AVOID THIS AIRLINE. IT IS CHEAP FOR\u2026\n",
            "Reading the reviews I must express my point of view. The language barrier can be frustrating, however, remember there are no translators so we're at a disadvantage.

            "We had a recent flight to Colombia, this past July 2nd-8th, and decided to go through Copa because from all the options they have always been the best... easy to travel, stops at Panama are stress free, good options for connecting, etc. This last time we were delayed by what\u2026\n",
            "Terrible service, 2 valuable items were stolen from our baggage and the airline will not even start an investigation to check cameras. It's unacceptable that people working for this company are stealing from passengers' belongings and nothing is being done.\n",

            "Worst Airline ever! I travelled many times, and have never in my life seen worst than this. Lack of compassion, rude staff, aircrafts are small and they are not accurate with timings! Worse, they advance flight times just 3 hours before the flight, with an email notice only!!! \u2026\n",
            "My mother and I purchased tickets back on March 16th, 2023, for a trip to Costa Rica. My mother experienced a major medical issue which eventually had her enter hospice care. I was provided a letter dated May 22nd by the providers for the hospice care with points of contact. \u2026\n",

Finally, they confiscate your water during a second security check before boarding and leave you dehydrated for the entire trip with zero service!!\u2026\n",
            "I dread having to fly with Copa. I've used them a number of times in the last couple of years and it's always the same none sense. Once you get on the plane, you are good, the airline and flight experience gets a pass, it's the Customer Service and the poor use of the\u2026\n",

            "Luggage Absolute disaster of an airline. They do not care about passengers or their experiences. The lack of consideration was appalling. I have flown all over the world for over 15 years and this was the WORST airline I have flown by far. Departing Cartagena to San\u2026\n",
            "I'm not prone to writing airline reviews but my experience was so awful I decided to share it, maybe somebody at Copa reads it and decides to do something to improve the service. I had a one week business trip to SF. To resume it in one line: - I've been a vegetarian for 17\u2026\n",
            "The flight itself was good as I am grateful I arrived safely, but experience with everything else was horrible. We had a second security check at the gate 2.5 hrs before the flight, meaning if you went to the bathroom after you did the full-on TSA check with your passport,\u2026\n",
            "Refused boarding claim pet documents did not have a return by dates . The documents were what is required by usa and Brazil , no place on documents for return dates. All shots and exams were up to date . No exuse paid for new tickets with competing airlines accepted same\u2026\n",

            "Our flight from the Gold Coast departed and arrived ontime. There were no delays. Flight was quite full. I was only disappointed that Virgin no longer include a snack with their free coffee tea and water. Their full service competitors do offer this. A bit of cost cutting so\u2026\n"

            "The managing booking process or check in process are mentally ill. I think the Chinese are not normal, they have mental problems, have you ever tried to check in with them? it's exhausting\n",
            "Very unfortunate experience with this company. On our flight from London to Beijing, the luggage did not arrive. Since we were in Beijing for just one night, they did not know when they could deliver the luggage to our next destination, so we had to agree to pick them up at\u2026\n",

However, I could not make it to the scheduled flight since I needed to fill in very detail health\u2026\n",
            "The worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. Due to Air China being unwilling and unable to advise on transit visa requirements; they advised me to book a new single ticket flight from the UK, stopping in China on my way to Japan. I had already purchased my return ticket with the\u2026\n",
            "The flight staff were eager to please and took great care of me. The food was good, I had seafood which was very tasty. The main drawback was the cost, it was more than twice what I had paid going the other direction on Shanghai Airlines. It was not worth that much.\n",
            "Took four flights All four flights were delayed with short notice Cabin is old fashioned, service and food average. It\u2019s cheap that\u2019s why I took this company\n",
            "The price of the fare was great. The food was not for me. Porridge had veges in it, omelets swam in water, cold pasta and frozen mixed veges for breakfast, thankfully everything comes with bread. Hostesses were friendly and attentive. Seats were average, big people really\u2026\n",
            "The worst experience of my life. 0 information, 2 days lost in the airport. They didn't give us support or solution to face the situation\n",
            "this was my worst experience with an airline i have ever had. like most people on the flight we had been drawn in by the low price of the tickets but i could not recommend more forking out just an extra \u00a3100 to fly with a decent airline. my flight was cancelled and rescheduled 2\u2026\n",
            "I need to say it was my worst airline experience ever! Ok, screens were not functioning during the flights (both in and return), but the flying crew was so relaxed that we could file a complaint after. But since then, I have received a reply from customer support, like one\u2026\n",
            "Great service with crew members passing every half an( even during night flight)with water and beverages. My vegetarian meal was non embarked but they did the best to give me one. Relaxed but attentive service , I will fly again with Air China!\n",

When I reached my hotel in Kunming I noticed some of the items worth around 100 euro, were missing from my checked in baggage. I tried to report to Airchina desk at Kunming airport while returning and they suggested\u2026\n",
            "We booked tickets with specific seats reserved (we payed for them). They changed the airplane and could not give us the seats for which we have payed for, but they didn\u2019t give us equivalent ones but the worse in the plane even when we insisted many times. The service we received\u2026\n",

I had 8 hours in Shanghai airport. You can get 4 hours in a lounge for \u00a350 but not 8 hours.\u2026\n",
            "Delayed flight from Bejing, so we missed the conecting flight to Oslo. Did not get help with new tickets, had to stay one night at the airport, order and pay new tickets ourselves. Terrible service, so avoid Air China if you can!!!!\n",
            "Awful airline. Changed times of all flights including connections from original 2 & 4 hours stop off in Beijing to 3 & 14 hours. This is absolutely ridiculous to have to wait/stop off for this long with three children in tow. Definitely would not ever use this airline again or\u2026\n",
            "Do NOT use Air China - they have an ancient website and APP. The APP online customer service is in Chinese with no option to translate. I travelled from Australia to London and was unable to access the online check-in therefore left with the aisle seat, the plane was\u2026\n",
            "The worst company I have ever flown with. Starting because when we went to check in online 24 hours in advance on the website it did not allow it and since you can only get them at the counter up to 3 hours before the departure of the flight I had to spend 100 euros on a train\u2026\n",
            "I urgently needed to reschedule my flight but only the office in Beijing provided 24 hours customer service support. I made a roaming call to the Beijing office and paid the difference in fare with my credit card. For unknown reason the payment was failed. The staff asked me to\u2026\n",
            "Was booked on Swiss but flight cancelled at the last moment and put on Air China. The lucky part is the new A350 are used on this route so there are pods with lay flat beds. Big improvement on previous flying wreck of Air China I experienced again as the result of a last minute\u2026\n",
            "Did the Air China (China Eastern aircraft) massive journey with 8 hours at Shanghai airport a giant of a place. Solo. Not with family. Food good, plenty of it. Ask for more you will be ok. English is ok crew do their best. Boeing 777 - 300ER very nice quiet seating is 3-4-3 the\u2026\n",
            "I have to say that Air China was overall a great airline when it comes to the overall on board experience. Zero delays - friendly service and I have to admit it very good food and beer. The offered space was good - nothing special but definitely above a German or US standard.\u2026\n",
            "I've never traveled in an empty plane and had the airline hostesses who didn't accept the seat change to make them wider. Result ..... everyone stuck in the narrow seats and I tested positive on the swab covid. Company to be reported, I advise against it even if they give you\u2026\n",

            "One of the worst experience I ever had. Before reviewing the plane, I would like to say the air stewards are pleasant and probably compensate the whole 6.5 hours journey. The plane is likely to be old without USB port to charge my mobile and entertainment choices were\u2026\n",
            "During the registration I was told that there were no other seats than the middle ones but then I found out that they were empty seats in the back but I was refused to change the seat by the hostess. Being a 1.89 m man sitting in the middle with a tiny space to place my legs , I\u2026\n",
            "Horrible customer service. Didn't reply emails until you submitted an official complain to Air China mainland website. The customers also didn't honor their statement in the phone call for ticket refund and you need to submit a DOT complain so they will contact you.\n",
            "Air China intercontinental flight Australia, my first time experiencing Air China's business class (Phenix miles frequent flyer with the economy). The flight provides numerous snacks and food (although it tastes ordinary), and there is an onboard entertainment installation\u2026\n",
            "Air China still flies with old airbuses and doesn\u2019t offer any entertainment on a 9 hour flight. There is no service on board and i mean absolutely no service. You can\u2019t order anything and there is no digital entertainment or even loading outputs for your own digital devices! On\u2026\n",
            "My first trip by Air China business class and let\u2019s just say it\u2019ll definitely be my last. Paid a 14000 CNY difference to upgrade and received almost nothing for it. Seats are pretty much the same size as economy (can only recline slightly, cannot lie flat!) I really didn\u2019t see\u2026\n",

            "Boarding smooth, departure on time. Service was pretty good, although the meal was worse than other domestic Air China flights in shorter routes. Not sure if this was luck of the draw, or does catering really vary by route (best meal was on Beijing Shanghai route, which is only\u2026\n",

            "Used this service via Beijing with a long layover there, which gave me a chance to look at the hutongs in the city. Unfortunately I missed my connecting flight to Vancouver, but thanks to my very useful guide in Beijing, Joe Qiao, they booked me on the next day's flight and\u2026\n",
            "Air China is expensive and offering the lowest possible service. No food in the lounge at 13.30 PM. Delayed flight. Priority check in means you will board the aircraft at the end and you cannot store your hand luggage. No drinks after late boarding even when you arrived\u2026\n",

An auxiliary wheel was broken off on the flight to Heathrow. I could still ride it but with difficulties. On the flight back to Sydney from\u2026\n",

            "I am very frustrated with AirChina. My boyfriend and I booked our flights a year ago through FlyUs. AirChina cancelled the flights and we paid FlyUs 75$ for each flight to get refunded. Back in March, we paid the $150 total for our flight refund, yet we never got our money back\u2026\n",
            "No problems on this flight. Food was pretty bad, on the similar flight to Shanghai the snack was much better. No problem with boarding and disembarkation either. Plane is older, seats uncomfortable. Overall, felt (and was) a budget flight.\n",

            "Well I can NOT recommend Air China. The plane was ok the flight it self was ok. But seat allowances is hopeless. We booked a cruise package and Air China was the allocated airline. We new we weren\u2019t going to get much but you would at least think they could see our names Mr\u2026\n",
            "Good service . Food ok . Great sleep but the seats are very slim. I couldn\u2019t help think of my brother in law who wouldn\u2019t have fitted in it. He\u2019s not fat just a tall big person\n",
            "I was sold this flight by a travel agent who warned me it was cheap for a reason and would be horrific. The opposite is true. A new airline has new planes. We flew via Shanghai and both times, the food coming out of China was scary, I suspect because all airline food is\u2026\n",
            "I loved that the staff was helpful and appreciate their kindness. Also, the food and beverage options were relatively better than other flights.\n",
            "I flew found trip on air China. The fare was super low and I figured in business class, it would be ok. A few things to note. If you have a long layover, the airline has some perks to help you. I found them worthless as there was no one or nothing in the airport that told you\u2026\n",
            "Passengers were stranded in Jakarta for 18 hours without clear explanation. Airline staff nowhere to be found. Finally ground handler took to hotel which was very bad. People missing connecting flights and didn't get compensation. Bags wreceived after 3 days. In Beijing\u2026\n",
            "After a long flight from Vienna to Peking we had our connection flight to Singapore (which is also a long flight). We did not slept well on the first flight, so we hoped to get some sleep on the second flight. Unfortunately the flight was close to Chinese New Year so many many\u2026\n",
            "Nice flight with decent food and very courteous service. One problem was running out of toilet paper before landing in Bejing for a layover. The worst part was Air China changed our return flight from Seoul to Bejing which would have caused us to miss our connecting flight to\u2026\n",
            "Flight was not bad. Everything you expect from the business class was there. Nice and friendly crew. Not really the \"extra-mile\", but \"business-class-as-usual\"\n",
            "From the beggining, all the Staff were helpful and speaks understandable English. The airplanes and all the services aboard were ok. Pequim airport is amazing and it's worth paying a visit. The only complaint, in my point of view, is regarding the Chinese people. Their behavior\u2026\n",
            "Be aware of this important detail: when you are connecting from Houston to another country, like i did to get to Panama, DO NOT FORGET TO GET YOUR LUGGAGE AND GO THROUGH SECURITY WITH YOUR CHECKED LUGGAGE. I was told that my checked luggage would be checked right through to\u2026\n",
            "My daughter flew with them in October to Seoul. The flight was delayed but no bad. When the landed in Beijing she was worried since she didn't speak the language. She had no problems as the staff spoke English and were very helpful. The flight from Beijing to Seoul, and the\u2026\n",
            "We flew via Beijing and got caught up in evolving Coronavirus cancellations. At every stage, every member of Air China staff were 100% helpful, efficient and effective - both going and returning. Check in and flight change desks - overnight hotel - pick ups - re-schduling and\u2026\n",
            "Staff is very helpful, very clean , quiet flight, in time , meals was nice. We had enough place for the legs. We will take it again.\n",
            "Flight was partially canceled due to coronavirus. Requested a refund 2/11 and got a confirmation email saying I would get confirmation in 6 days, it didn't happen. Called today 3/2 and they \"never received\" my refund request, had to submit another and now need to wait \"6-8 weeks\u2026\n",
            "During Chinese New Year we have been visiting Myanmar. The only direct flight that is offered from Beijing to Yangon is Air China. The flight to Myanmar is a late evening flight, the flight back leaves at 23:55. And that is a problem. We left almost on time but nobody is\u2026\n",
            "The check in was smooth and we did not have to wait too long. The flight was pleasant as it was under 2 hours. We were surprised they served us a sandwich for such a short flight. It was a good flight and reasonably priced.\n",
            "Absolute Perfection! My husband and I flew business class and were treated like royalty. Elegant amenities and dining experience. Our accommodations were luxurious. We felt spoiled and were so impressed with China Air. Best overall business class travel experience we have\u2026\n",
            "I had an enjoyable flight with an empty seat beside me. On checkin, the seat beside me was blocked, to enable me to have the comfort of having an empty seat beside me. Air China has now done this for me a few times when the flight was not full. A major advantage of flying a lot\u2026\n",
            "I cannot believe they lost my luggage. Normally I like Air China as they have more legroom than even Air Canada, however, on this trip while jumping to India, they managed to lose our luggage. This caused a 2 day delay due to the second itinerary with compensation being almost\u2026\n",

            "I was flying this airline because my original flight of PIA was cancelled due to Corona virus scare. Beijing Airport was very nicely maintained and gave an excellent look. The aircraft was very neat and clean and the crew was very sweet and helping. They helped me adjust my over\u2026\n",
            "Talk about horrors. The plane looked as if it wasn't cleaned in a month (and smelled like it too). There were several small children coughing, sneezing, crying, acting out. The food was literally not edible. If you aren't Asian looking or Chinese, you will be treated as if (the\u2026\n",
            "Flew on a Boeing 777 from LAX to Beijing, switched to a Boeing 787 to Singapore. The B787 seat width seems narrower than B777. The food was paltry. Did get a few beers and wines. The flight attendants were helpful, professional and polite. We were able to quickly get a\u2026\n",
            "In all of the flights the airline was hours late, because one way or another they had to wait for the plane to arrive from China. Had a huge issue coming back and I had to wait 4hrs for their customer service to open up weekend hours Pacific time, that made me loose my flight\u2026\n",
            "Flights were ok going, nothing special. Food ok. Flights back; leg 1 to Taipei was awful, plane was small couldn\u2019t move in your seat,( like Allegiant out of Bellingham) Second leg ; was better. Food gross, gave us noodles with chicken or fish for breakfast, ugh I booked all\u2026\n",

            "Took my money \u00a3450 then cancelled flight 2 days later when SA border closed. Remonstrated with SA rep. as I wanted money back. Turkish Airlines had done so with cancelled flight few days earlier. Explained my mobile phone had been stolen and I had no way of contacting anyone for\u2026\n",
            "Absolutely terrible experience - where other companies are doing their best in the times we are living in - South African Airways cancelled all their international flights without warning. The airline knew this was happening but still allowed me to board a flight from Mauritius\u2026\n",
            "Loved the all-new A350 plane. Seats divert into beds. We could sleep 12 hours during the almost 16 hour flight. Quality of service and food was questionable. The Rip-Eye steak was so tough, I was unable to cut it.\n",
            "We\u2019ve had a great experience with SAA customer service during the Corona pandemic. They\u2019ve agreed for us to rebook our ticket free of charge. We booked through an online agent and should have used them to rebook the ticket but we cannot get hold of them (just a message saying\u2026\n",
            "SA 191 celebrated a brand new aircraft. Was 30 minutes late into Mauritius. Gave all gate personnel flower garlands at the gate in Mauritius. Left M 1,5 hours late. We missed connecting fligts to Zurich and Stockholm in Johannesburg due to celebration and late arriving SA 191.\u2026\n",
            "Very clean plane and economy seats are quite roomy. Toilets could have been cleaned more regularly. All flight staff were friendly and eager to assist and make the flight as enjoyable as possible. Entertainment was limited. My goodness flight crew do tolerate some very bad\u2026\n",
            "The flight wasn\u2019t full which considering the crew was a good thing. The staff were abrupt to the point of rudeness. They don\u2019t answer the call bell when it\u2019s pressed. This resulted in my husband going to get us bottles of water, only to be told by the crew he wasn\u2019t allowed to\u2026\n",
            "I hopped on SAA Flight 61 from Lagos to Cape Town via Johannesburg in December 2019. We had an one-time departure and good weather enroute. The legroom was okay as well as the in-flight entertainment. The crew was very courteous and made us feel at home.\n",
            "The cabin crew on the flight both to Mozambique SA142 and the flight back to South Africa A145 was absolutely professional and a delight to fly with.\n",
            "I travelled on business class in February on a private trip. The flight left 1 hour after the time. I am flying on economy this time and again the flight times have changed there\u2019s no mortification. Atleast their business lounge is the best so compensate for waiting. The\u2026\n",
            "Leg room is a joke and so was the food - I wouldn't give my dog the food they served us! Longest, most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on. Avoid using them if you can. And they are EXPENSIVE!\n",
            "The airline is under financial pressure which is always an incentive to provide good service. And the airbus 330 business class now has all the amenities in a side panel which also offers more privacy. Very good flight.\n",
            "Whilst this was a short flight, it was a nice flight. The flight attendant made the effort to make us comfortable.\n",

            "Departure was brought forward due to French Air Traffic Controllers' strike and need to divert away from French airspace over Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Tunisia before re-joining original direct track over Algeria. Interesting to watch on the seat-back map. Arrived more\u2026\n",
            "The aircraft was on older one. The seats were really small. On my flight from Munich to Johannesburg, my entertainment system was not working.\n",
            "Great service, excellent pilots, happy flights and good aircraft. SAA can still be proud even if it is under administration.\n",
            "Despite all the expectation, the flights to/from Mozambique were amazing. The attention received from the flight attendants was amazing. Some lack of information before the check-in was the negative point of the trip\n",
            "I had never even heard of South African when I chose to fly with them. I was nervous to say the least. But they were amazing on the way to Ghana. The cleanliness and Food was amazing. They had great inflight movies and shows to watch as well. Thanks South African.\n",
            "the flights to and from were smooth and the crew very friendly. i had the opportunity to get an additional beer.\n",

            "Flights were cancelled due to the strikes. Was put on an Air Mauritius flight two days later, and therefore had to incur additional expenditure on accommodation for those two nights. SAA have ignored all communication with regards to some kind of refund on the additional\u2026\n",
            "The flight was only one hour which was great as we had just come off and 8 hour flight. The whole process worked like clockwork. The planes were smaller but the crew was awesome. Check-in was a breeze.\n",
            "South African is a great airline. We left on time and the ride was perfectly smooth. The service was great and courteous. The food was very good. I highly recommend this airline\n",
            "Just as much as SAA grounded its flights on this route, the smaller plane operated by Comair was just as good and satisfying like the BA that I boarded the previous day to Johannesburg. Everything was on the cards as expected, similar to the BA service.\n",
            "This flight is operated by Airlink for SA airways. Nice modern jet, very clean and nice screw. Less than an hour flight but still managed a refreshment.\n",
            "A very good airline at a very good price for direct flights,meals are as good as any other airline,legroom is one of the best for economy travel,in flight entertainment as good as any.Get you from London to Johannesburg as fast as Virgin or British Airways at a fraction of the\u2026\n",
            "Very poor experience for a international flight. The crew was rude with passengers, plane was old, dirty and seats are definitely uncomfortable. Some video screens were not working as well. Food and beverage was OK.\n",
            "Functional short haul flight - no frills expected so not disappointed but plane looked very tired, not especially clean perhaps down to the financial issues SAA are going through. Many flights being cancelled at short notice - we were lucky to get ours.\n",
            "Very good flight both ways. Accommodated my food request. Nice to get both hot dinner and breakfast, with proper cutlery. Only downside flip down trays very small. Plenty of legroom. Poor entertainment options.\n",
            "I have flown SAA before and whilst it was not WOW, one could expect decent service. However, on my trip I noticed the following: 1. Toilets not so clean. These days most airlines have disposable toilet seat liners. Over and above that the toilets just were not clean. These are\u2026\n",
            "I've not sued SS for several years and was very disappointed to find poor service, old aircraft and bad food. Compared to Qatar, Emirates & even China South Airlines, SAA is years behind. The air stewards were not very friendly and during standard food service were no-where to\u2026\n",
            "We were very skeptical by flying with SAA. But from the word go we were so impressed. Check in went so smoothly until boarding. Food from the best i ever had on a plane. Will definitely use SAA in the future for sure ! On the way back to South Africa there was a problem\u2026\n",
            "A pleasant daylight flight on SAA. Cabin service was good with attentive cabin personnel. Choices somewhat limited in terms of inflight entertainment. Beverage service was excellent as compared to some Middle East airlines.\n",

            "I recently travelled to Maputo via Johannesburg on business. The service on board from Heathrow to Johannesburg was spoiled by the quality of food and drink, which fell far below what I would expect in business class. The food was basic and less than generous. Asking for a\u2026\n",
            "Disappointing on how SAA handles business. Several last minute flight cancels, slow to respond with rebooking. I am star alliance gold yet couldn\u2019t gain access to the lounges because they cancelled flights and moved me to code shares.\n",

            "I am so sad that SAA is in difficulty. It is truly an excellent airline. The aircraft and crew are wonderful. The crew, in particular, is warm, welcoming, and attentive. I have never had a bad experience--either on ground or in the air. Of course, being South African, I may be\u2026\n",
            "SAA is our airline of choice when flying between Harare and Zimbabwe. Not only are they the busiest (3 to 4 flights per day) between these 2 cities but they are the most punctual. There may be one or 2 competitors that are slightly cheaper, but those airlines often have delays\u2026\n",
            "This was a full flight. The legroom was adequate, crew friendly and the were magnificent view of Victoria Falls as we were leaving Livingstone.\n",
            "All my flights were booked and paid for through Virgin Australia however little did I know that they Co-shear with SAA. SAA personal is not truthful people - during check-in I asked if the aircraft was full and was told Yes \"every seat is taken\" however there was not one person\u2026\n",
            "I have 258k air miles with Voyager which I wanted to use to upgrade on Ethiopian airlines. Now bear in mind that they are both members of star alliance so you would presume if Ethiopian had upgrade availability it wouldn\u2019t be a problem THINK AGAIN.

            "This is the worst airline experience I have ever had. I was traveling to Zambia with my aunt and uncle. I am actually shocked to find some good reviews here, although I noticed that most of them are for short distance (local flights).1. The flight attendants are lazy and rude.\u2026\n",
            "I was trepidational about doing this flight but, I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the flight. Great cabin attendants and most helpful and happy. The airline is passing through troubled times but the professionalism is not lacking.\n",
            "Pro\u2019s - This airline is always on time, I have flown with them many times and this is their one real strength, and I like their blankets Cons - their customer service is appalling, never return phone calls even if you lucky enough to actually get to speak to someone, emails\u2026\n",
            "It seems that SAA has either good or bad days At times one gets a great service, at times a bad one Would be good to be constantly great (if possible)\n",
            "Flight was good with nice meals. In flight entertainment a bit disappointing as films very limited.
